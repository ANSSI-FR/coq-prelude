## Getting Started

### Installing From Source

To install it from source, just use the `Makefile` provided with the source tree:

```bash
sudo make install
```

To uninstall it, you can just delete the directory `Prelude` in
`/usr/lib/coq/user-contrib`, that is:

```bash
sudo rm -r /usr/lib/coq/user-contrib/Prelude
```
